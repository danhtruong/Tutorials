The hypotheses of the Fisherâ€™s exact test are the same than for the Chi-square test, that is:

$H_{0}$ : the variables are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. Knowing the value of one variable does not help to predict the value of the other variable
$H_{1}$ : the variables are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. Knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(
  "smoke_no" = c(7, 0),
  "smoke_yes" = c(2, 5),
  row.names = c("Athlete", "Non-athlete"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
colnames(dat) <- c("Non-smoker", "Smoker")

dat
```

```{r}
chisq.test(dat)$expected
```

```{r}
test <- fisher.test(dat)
test
```
